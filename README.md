# Minilyser
A barebones layout analyser made written in Python

## Usage

You must have Python installed. The exact version at which this breaks is to be determined, but this as written in Python 3.11.

First, add the desired corpus txt to the "corpora" directory.
Then, run `py ./makedata.py` to generate the data for a specific corpus. Follow instructions in the program.
Then, run `py ./minilyser.py`, then follow instructions.
